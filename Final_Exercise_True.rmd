This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t") -> combined_data
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
subset(combined_data, country == "United States") -> US_data
ggplot(data = US_data, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_point(size = 2)
subset(combined_data, country == "China") -> China_data
ggplot(data = China_data, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_point(size = 2)
subset(combined_data, country == "El Salvador") -> El_Salvador_Data
ggplot(data = El_Salvador_Data, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_point(size = 2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. For example the sum of 2 + 2 = `r 2 + 2`
